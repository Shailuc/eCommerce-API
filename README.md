ACCESSING PAYFIRMA JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY
The Payfirma JavaScript library provides a set of client-side functionality for making API calls in order to accept payments.

By including the Payfirma JavaScript code in your payment form, it allows you to easily encrypt credit card information before it is transmitted. This encrypted information is passed to your server where you can make a simple server-to-server call to process the transaction. Information on both Client-Side & Server-Side calls are included in our library.

To access our JavaScript Library, use the following URL: 
http://www.payfirma.com/media/payfirma.minified.js
It is recommended to download the JavaScript file and place it on your own fileserver to ensure a seamless service.

With our Quickstart guide, you can learn how to set up an integration to easily accept payments on your website. This is available on our website
